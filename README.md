# Budget Plus:

An all inclusive Budgeting application dedicated to my sister because she's not that great at managing her money(I still love her). Budget Plus provides users with a functional and aesthetically pleasing user-interface that calculates a monthly budget based on the income and expense figures inputted by the user. I applied concepts of DOM manipulation and event delegation to implement the core UI interactive functionalities.


Here is a photo of the app:
